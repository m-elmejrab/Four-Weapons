# Four-Weapons
An incomplete 2D sidescroller for Brakeys Game Jam 2017

The idea was to give the player a choice of 4 characters with different weapons, they engage in one huge level that is traversable in diffent ways depnding on the character you choose.

Due to time limitation, basic functionality only was implemented (jump, punch, climb, enemies), no further work undertaken after Jam deadline.
